# Lan subnetting and Rip routing


## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a VLSM-based LAN addressing scheme and dynamic routing using RIP v2 in a simulated enterprise network.

The network includes multiple departmental subnets, server segments, and backbone links, configured within the 192.168.15.0/24 address space.

## Key Concepts
- Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
- LAN segmentation by department
- Router interface configuration
- RIP version 2 dynamic routing
- Routing table analysis and connectivity validation

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Validation
End-to-end connectivity was verified using ICMP testing and routing table inspection (`show ip route`).
